			<h1>Copy/paste text passages, undo/redo your actions</h1>
			<p>To perform these operations, use the corresponding icons at the top toolbar:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Copy</b> – select a text fragment and use the <b>Copy</b> <img alt="Copy icon" src="../images/copy.png" /> icon to copy the selection to the computer clipboard memory. The copied text can be later inserted to another place in the same document, into another document, or into some other program.</li>
				<li><b>Paste</b> – find the place in your document where you need to paste the previously copied text fragment and use the <b>Paste</b> <img alt="Paste icon" src="../images/paste.png" /> icon.
				The text will be inserted at the current cursor position. The text can be previously copied from the same document, from another document or from some other program.</li>
				<li><b>Undo</b> – use the <b>Undo</b> <img alt="Undo icon" src="../images/undo.png" /> icon to undo the last operation you performed.</li>
				<li><b>Redo</b> – use the <b>Redo</b> <img alt="Redo icon" src="../images/redo.png" /> icon to redo the last undone operation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: for the security reasons some browsers don't allow access to your computer clipboard. So when you try to select one of the cutting operations, the program will ask you to use the keyboard shortcuts common for all browsers: <b>Ctrl+X</b> for cutting, <b>Ctrl+C</b> for copying, <b>Ctrl+V</b> for pasting.</p>
